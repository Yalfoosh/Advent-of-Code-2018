# Advent of Code 2018
#### By Yalfoosh

This repository holds the code for the 2018 version of Advent of Code. I don't really compete in it the traditional way and instead use the opportunity to learn a new language. As such, I take plenty of time to program something and usually do it during the later days of December, when I have the time.

This year, I've decided to focus doing the Advent of Code tasks in Rust. Rust is a relatively new programming languages similar to C++. Although C++ is the god among modern performant languages, it is plagued by poor design decisions, lack of safety and undefined behaviour. Rust attempts to right some of its wrongs while creating a language that competes with C in speed. Because of my recent interest in AI development, Rust is an interesting language to learn because it is fast, has a developed ecosystem and I believe it can be what C# is to Java - a better replacement given enough time.

Even if Rust turns out to be a fluke, I still hope this AoC will be a worthy experience.

# Usage

After you compile this project, you can use it in the following way:

In the folder where your compiled binary exists, add folders for each day's input named with this pattern: "day#", where # is the day. For an example, a folder containing the input for day 15 would be named "day15".

In it, unless specified below, should be a file containing your input named "input.txt". If the executable doesn't find the input.txt in the folder it's supposed to be for the day specified, it will simply crash.

## Specific format for input folder:

 - None so far.

# ToS

All code in this repository can be used as long as you contact me first. I am not responsible for any kind of damage caused by using my code in any way, however.
